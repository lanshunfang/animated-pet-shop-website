          Our part-time workers/volunteers are <span style="font-weight:bold;">Gloria Ibarra, Rachel Craver</span> and students from local schools.  Without their constant help, we would not be able to function as an efficiently ran pet store.  My sincere thank you to all of them!  I am sure you see every one of them helping customers except Susan.  She comes to our store early before store hours and she is gone before our store opens.  You will see her with her husband, Joseph, doing recycling when she is not at our store.  Say Hi when you see her blue truck full of cardboard boxes!!<img src="public/img/staff2.jpg" style="float:right;height:250px;border-radius: 50px;align=middle">
